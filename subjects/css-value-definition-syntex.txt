CSS value definition syntax:


For example, here's the syntax for the value of the margin shortcut property:

    [ <length> | <percentage> | auto ]{1,4}

which can describe the following:

    margin: 0px;
    margin: 1px 10%;
    margin: 1px 0px auto;
    margin: 1px 0px 1px 0px;


Quote < >
=========

    Basic CSS data types appear between < and >.

    For example, <time>, <color>, and <uri> are basic types that
    are defined elsewhere.  When you see one of these types, you
    know that any valid value in that data type may be used.

    Any words between “<” and “>” give a type of value or a reference
    to another property. For example:

        <length> means that a fixed length value such as 10px.

    When a keyword appears without quotes, it indicates that the
    word should be used as it is, such as in the case of the "auto"
    keyword in the above example.

    More example of value definition:

        [ <length> | thick | thin ]{1,4}
        [ <family-name> , ]* <family-name>
        <url>? <color> [ / <color> ]?
        <url> || <color>

    The forward slash (/) and the comma (,) must also be used literally.


Bracket []
==========

    Brackets ([]) group values together into one unit.
    It enclose several entities, combinator, and multiplier
    then transform them as a single component.

    They are used to group components to bypass the precedence rules


---------------------------



------ rules --------

Let capital leter such as A, B, X, Y be components consist of
key words, literals, or data types, then:

A | B | C
Alternative:
    Only one of A or B or C (non optional)

A || B
logical or:
    A or B or both.
    At least one of them must present (non optional).
    Order not important.

A && B
logical And:
    A and B are both mandatory
    Order not important.

A B C
Justaposition:
    means all of component are mandatory
    must occur with order as shown (the only rules where order matters).

Precedence:

    ----- Highest
        =spaces=  Juxtapositon
        &&        AND
        ||        OR
        |         Alternative
    ------ Lowest

    Precedence examples:

      • Juxtaposition has precedence over the double ampersand, eg:

            A B && C

            means: [A B] && C.
            correct:   A B C or C A B
            incorrect: B A C (order of juxtaposition was not preserve)

      • The double ampersand has precedence over the double bar

            A || B && C
            means: A || [B && C]
            correct:

               A B C
               A C B
               B C A
               C B A
               B C
               C B
               A

            incorrect:

               B A C (B and C must not be broken up, as they are a unit as component)
               C A B (B and C must not be broken up, as they are a unit as component)

      • The double bar has precedence over the single bar


            A | B || C
            means: A | [ B || C ]
            correct:
                A
                B
                C
                B C
                C B
            incorrect:
                A B ( either A or  [B || C] )


Multiplyer
=========

    A*
    A can be repeated zero or more (A is optional)

    A+
    A can be repeated one or more (A is not optional)

    A?
    A can be repeated zero or maximum of one. (A is optional)
