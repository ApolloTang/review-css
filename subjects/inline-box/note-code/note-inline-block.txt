An inline-blockelement relates to other elements and content
as an inline box.
    The bottom of the inline-block element will rest on the baseline
    of the text line by default and will not line-break within itself

Inside the inline-blockelement, the content is formatted as though
the element were block-level.
    The properties width and height apply to it, as they do to
    any block-level or inline replaced element, and those
    properties will increase the height of the line if they are
    taller than the surrounding content.

Important different between display:inline and display:inline-block
    inline element ignore "width" and "text-align" properties, but
    inline-block will hornors both.

[Warning]  white-space btw inline-block will affect the rendering.
