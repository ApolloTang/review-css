    Avoid element selectors:
    -----------------------

        Use only semantics selector:

            span or div holds has no semantic.
            h1 has some semantic.
            Properly named class defined on an element is semantics.

        Example:

            Bad:

                <div class="fld">
                    <span>Folder Name</span>
                </div>

                - - - - - -

                /* The Folder Module */
                .fld span { ... }

            Good:

                <div class="fld">
                    <span class="fld-name">Folder Name</span>
                    <span class="fld-items">(32 items)</span>
                </div>

                - - - - - -

                /* The Folder Module */
                .fld { ... }
                .fld-name { ... }
                .fld-items { ... }


        The more semantically generic the HTML element (like a
        span or div), the more likely it will create a conflict.

        Use element selector only if you are extremely confident
        that the element will not be confused with another
        element.

        If you do wish to use an element selector, it should be within one
        level of a class selector. In other words, you should be in a situation
        to use child selectors.

        Elements with greater semantics like headings are more likely to
        appear by themselves within a container and you are more likely
        able to use an element selector successfully.

            <div id="sidebar">
                <h2>Side Note</h2>
            </div>

            - - - - -

            #sidebar { ... }
            #sidebar > h2 {...}
