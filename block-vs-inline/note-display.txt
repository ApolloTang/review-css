    A block element is an element that has the following characteristics:

        • If no width is set, will expand naturally to fill its parent container
        • have margins and/or padding
        • If no height is set, will shrink to height of its child
          elements (assuming they are not floated or positioned)
        • By default, will be placed below previous elements in the markup
          (assuming no floats or positioning on surrounding elements)
        • Ignores the vertical-align property




Inline Elements:
================

    b, big, i, small, em, strong,
    a, br, img, map, object, q, script, span, sub, sup
    button, input, label, select, textarea

    • Flows along with text content
    • Will drop to the next line like
    • Subject to white-space settings in CSS
    • Subject to the vertical-align property
    • Ignore top and bottom margin settings, but will apply left and
      right margins, and any padding
    • Ignore the width and height properties
    • If floated left or right, becomes a block-level element

Generally speaking:

    can

        put any block element inside another block element.
        put any inline element inside a block element,
        inline element inside any other inline element.

    cannot

        put a block element inside an inline element — with one exception:

            You can wrap an <a> element around any content, whether it
            be block elements, or inline elements or a mixure of both.
